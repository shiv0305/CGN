            <h3>Meteor Facts</h3>
            <p>A meteor is a streak of light in the sky caused by a small piece of space debris, such as a rock or dust particle, burning up in Earth's atmosphere. Most meteors that we see with the naked eye are no larger than a pebble, though some can be as large as a car..</p>
